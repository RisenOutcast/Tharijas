# Tharijas
TBS Monster Card Game made with Unity.
 
This game was part of a final project in a vocational school I went to 2016-2019. The idea was to make a game where you have your monster that you powerup through playing cards and then battle another monster.

# Gameplay
The game uses a turn-based system where first rounds are used for card playing and the next two for monster battle.
The project files still hold ![Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/) files, for a multiplayer mode that never got finished and was scrapped for lack of time. 

Here is a teaser trailer released little before halfway of the development ![YouTube](https://youtu.be/VsAdoEgv6lw)
